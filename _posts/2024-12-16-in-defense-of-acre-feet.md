Let me start by asking a simple question: is it easier for you to visualize, in your mind's eye, a million gallons of water or an Olympic-size swimming pool? Or for you cynics out there: is it easier to visualize a million milliliters of water or one cubic meter? 

I believe there's an obvious answer to either question, and in this post I'd like to use the acre-foot as a case-study to explore (a) why this is, (b) what it means for the communication breakdowns between the communities using US Customary and Standard International units, and (c) what we can learn from the acre-foot to help us code-switch our science communication. Hear me out.

<h2>The case against the acre-foot</h2>
I've seen many criticisms of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acre-foot" target="_blank">acre-foot</a> (or _ac-ft_) from the international scientific community, including one focused on the fact that it combines an area and a depth unit (isn't that the definition of volume? But I digress...). Here's the thing: on the surface, of course they're right. Neither acres nor feet make any sense in our modern scientific age, really: the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acre" target="_blank">acre</a> originated as the approximate unit of land that a yoke of oxen could plow in a day and, as we all know from the name, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foot_(unit)#Historical_origin" target="_blank">foot</a> has varied, ancient, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropometry" target="_blank">anthropometric</a> origins... but this isn't a history lesson, and I trust you can read the Wikipedia pages yourself. The point is that we've diligently and meticulously <a href="https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k3098j.image.f1082.langFR" target="_blank">defined</a> and <a href="https://opg.optica.org/ao/abstract.cfm?uri=ao-2-5-455" target="_blank">redefined</a> and <a href="https://www.npl.co.uk/si-units/metre" target="_blank">redefined</a> standard international (SI) units like the meter and the gram, and we should use them for science. I agree. I grew up in the US, so as hard as it is for me to intuitively grasp how much I weigh in kilograms, or how hot (or cold?) I'll be at 20 degrees Celsius, or what a cubic meter per second is when I spent my entire professional career working with cubic feet per second, I still agree that these are the units we should use for science and I use them in my research and in my publications.

For sake of completeness, I'll remind you that an acre is defined as 43,560 square feet (which, by the way, makes an acre-foot 43,560 cubic feet) and that this is about the size of an American football field (without the end zones) and somewhere near one half of a professional football (soccer) pitch. A foot is roughly 0.3048 meters, so an acre-foot is roughly equivalent to 1233.48 cubic meters. This is not close to a nice round number, to be sure, and I can understand the frustration that someone who is familiar with cubic meters might have at being forced to do the mental unit-conversion-math during a presentation at a scientific conference (for example).

You may have already noticed, but we're actually circling around my central point here, which is this: _different units of measure are contextually intuitive_ - i.e., they are intuitive based on where you grew up (the US vs <a href="https://sites.isucomm.iastate.edu/timothyl/imperial-in-a-metric-world/" target="_blank">nearly anywhere else</a>) or, more generally, they are intuitive based on your life experiences. If you've never seen an Olympic-sized swimming pool or an American football field, then neither the pool nor the football field analogy are going to be effective examples to use to bring things into perspective, regardless of the units against which we're trying to compare.

<h2>The case for the acre-foot</h2>
Admittedly, the acre-foot is a unique unit. I've been racking my brain and perusing the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_unusual_units_of_measurement">list of unusual units of measurement</a> to think of another unit that combines two different units for the same dimension (something like the kilowatt-hour doesn't count because kilowatts and hours are two different dimensions), and I've only come up with two: the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Board_foot">board foot</a> and the hectare-meter - the latter of which I have seen in the scientific literature as, I believe, merely an SI version of the acre-foot. So, carpentry aside, it appears that this may be unique to the field of hydrology where, perhaps, we simply need to convey how much water there is when it floods in a way that people understand. 

<h2>Exceptions</h2>
[discuss the issue of compacts and treaties where acre-feet are involved as a necessary exception to the rule of using SI units for science]

<h2>The ethics of choosing the right units</h2>

<h2>What we can learn from psychology</h2>
Why are some units more intuitive than others?

<h2>What we can learn from science communicators</h2>
My engineering consulting career taught me many things, but perhaps above all it helped me refine my ability to convey complex technical information to general audiences. While I like to think of myself as a decent science communicator, I will readily admit that I'm not an expert in this field. [comment about due diligence, I did some research, but this is a blog post after all, not a journal article]

Outline for the Blog Post: "Why Units Matter: Science and Communication"
1. Introduction
Hook: A relatable example of how units shape our understanding (e.g., "What’s easier to imagine: a million gallons or an Olympic swimming pool?").
Thesis: Units matter—not just for precision in science but also for effective and ethical communication.

1. Units in Science: Precision and Standardization
Why Units Are Fundamental: Discuss the importance of consistent units in scientific research for reproducibility and international collaboration.
Example: Highlight the consequences of miscommunication, such as the infamous Mars Climate Orbiter loss due to unit conversion errors.
Transition: While scientists focus on precision, communicators need to focus on clarity.

1. Units in Communication: Making the Abstract Relatable
The Role of Intuitive Units: Why units like acre-feet are so useful for audiences (e.g., connecting a unit of volume to an area people can visualize).
Visual Example: Include or describe a graphic comparing an acre, an American football field, and a European football pitch to show the scale of an acre-foot.
Point: Intuitive units bridge the gap between scientific accuracy and public understanding.

1. The Ethics of Choosing Units
Misleading Units: How some communicators intentionally choose units like "billions of liters" to sensationalize data, creating a skewed perception.
Why It’s Unethical:
Manipulates audience emotions rather than informing them.
Erodes trust in science communication.
Call for Responsibility: Emphasize the need for communicators to prioritize clarity and honesty over impact.

1. Case Study: Acre-Feet in Action
Briefly describe a scenario (e.g., water management in the western U.S.) where acre-feet provides a meaningful way to communicate water volumes.
Compare this with an example where misleading units (e.g., "trillions of teaspoons") confused or alienated audiences.

1. Conclusion
Recap Key Points: Units matter for both scientists and communicators, but they serve different roles.
Final Takeaway: Responsible science communication requires using units that are both accurate and meaningful to the audience.
Invitation to Engage: Ask readers how they think units affect their understanding of scientific topics.
